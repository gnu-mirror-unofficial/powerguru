# Build an Redhat/Fedora .rpm package

# we can then build the binary package.
# older versions of Fedora used /usr/src/redhat/{SOURCES, BUILD} for
# everything, but the newer version appears to use one's home directory
# instead, so now you don't have to be root to build rpm packages.

# Debian uses a '~' character in their version names, which rpmbuild
# doesn't like, so for an RPM we convert it to a '_' instead. Then we
# have to rename the subdirectory to match the new version of the
# snapshot, and edit the configure* files to have the proper version
# name.
# Unlike creating a deb, which build their own source tarball, rpm
# requires we do it ourselves, and copy it to $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
