struct servent {
     char  *s_name;       /* official service name */
     char **s_aliases;    /* alias list */
     int    s_port;       /* port number */
     char  *s_proto;      /* protocol to use */
}

The members of the servent structure are:
     s_name The official name of the service.
     s_aliases A NULL-terminated list of alternative names for the service.
     s_port The port number for the service given in network byte order.
     s_proto The name of the protocol to use with this service.


struct protoent {
     char  *p_name;       /* official protocol name */
     char **p_aliases;    /* alias list */
     int    p_proto;      /* protocol number */
}

       The members of the protoent structure are:
       p_name The official name of the protocol.
       p_aliases A NULL-terminated list of alternative names for the protocol.
       p_proto The protocol number.

The  addrinfo  structure  used  by getaddrinfo() contains the following fields:

struct addrinfo {
       int              ai_flags;
       int              ai_family;
       int              ai_socktype;
       int              ai_protocol;
       socklen_t        ai_addrlen;
       struct sockaddr *ai_addr;
       char            *ai_canonname;
       struct addrinfo *ai_next;
}

getaddrinfo() is an excellent function that will return information on a particular host name (such as its IP address) and load up a struct sockaddr for you, taking care of the gritty details (like if it's IPv4 or IPv6.) It replaces the old functions gethostbyname() and getservbyname().T
